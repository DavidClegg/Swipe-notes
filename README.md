Visuals update TODO:
- Notes that take up more than one line appear connected to the next note rather than evenly spaces
- Input should be scrolled into view on mobile
- Swiping right slightly on desktop doesn't correctly strike the note (minor issue)
- Can't scroll up on mobile if there is more than a screen of notes
- TODO Title
- TODO Better colours
- Code cleanup
